# Weather-Data-Analysis-and-Storage-System

This project involves developing a comprehensive system for retrieving, analyzing, and storing historical weather data using the Open Meteo API. The system is designed to fetch weather information for a specific location and date range, calculate various weather metrics, and store the results in a relational database.

## Features and Functionality:
- Weather Data Retrieval: Utilizes the Open Meteo API to fetch daily weather data, including temperature, wind speed, and precipitation, for a specified location over a range of years.
- Data Storage: Integrates with SQLAlchemy and SQLite to manage and persist weather data efficiently. The data is stored in a database table with details on average temperature, maximum wind speed, and total precipitation.
- Data Analysis: Provides methods to calculate and display average temperature, maximum wind speed, and total precipitation over the specified time period.
- Error Handling: Includes robust error handling for API response validation and JSON parsing.
- Testing: Implements unit tests to ensure the functionality of weather data retrieval and processing.

## Highlights:
- Effective Data Management: Demonstrates effective use of SQLAlchemy for ORM-based database interactions.
- Comprehensive Weather Analysis: Incorporates detailed analysis and reporting of weather metrics.
- Integration of External API: Shows the ability to integrate and work with external APIs to fetch and utilize real-world data.
- Optimization and Best Practices: Incorporates best practices for database session management, error handling, and code optimization.
- 
This project highlights skills in API integration, data management, and Python programming, providing a solid foundation for building applications that require data retrieval and analysis.
